# Children-to-Root
 > A program which moves all files from folders into the root directory.
 
 **You must have node.js installed to run this program. If you don't yet have that, you can download it here:**
 https://nodejs.org/en/download/
 
 To run, either open `macOS.sh` or `Windows.bat`.
 
 Otherwise, reference the directory of this program in CMD/Terminal, followed by `npm run dev`.
 
 You'll be prompted to reference the target folder. When you press enter, it will scan every file within that folder, and all the files within all the sub-folders. It will then move those files to the root folder, (the one you've entered), while keeping the empty folders in place.
 
 This is useful for removing files which are sorted into annoying folders, or to annoy someone. Just remeber, there's no undo button, so keep a backup copy of the folder before running this script!!
